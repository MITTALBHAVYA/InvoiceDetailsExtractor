# Invoice Extraction Application

## Overview

The Invoice Extraction Application is a powerful tool built with Python and Streamlit that allows users to extract and process invoice details from various file types, including PDFs and images. This application leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Generative AI to provide structured data from invoices.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Supports uploading of PDF and image files.
- **Extraction Methods**: Offers two methods of extraction:
  - **Direct Extraction (Image-based)**: Processes images directly for extraction.
  - **Text Extraction (Text-based)**: Extracts text from PDFs and then processes the text.
- **Structured Output**: Provides extracted invoice details in a well-organized JSON format.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MITTALBHAVYA/InvoiceDetailsExtractor
   cd invoice-extraction-app
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

3. **Run the Application**

   Start the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will launch the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

1. **Upload a File**

   Use the file uploader to choose an invoice file. Supported formats include PDF and common image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF).

2. **Select Extraction Method**

   Choose between:
   - **Direct Extraction (Image-based)**: Suitable for image files.
   - **Text Extraction (Text-based)**: Suitable for PDF files.

3. **Process the File**

   Click the "Process" button to start the extraction. The application will process the file and display the extracted details.

4. **View Results**

   The extracted details will be displayed in a structured format. You can see customer details, product information, and the total amount extracted from the invoice.
